# @tom-mcIvor's Recipe Remix

An AI-powered web app that helps you find the perfect recipe based on ingredients you already have. Simply input your available ingredients, and get a curated list of delicious recipe options to choose from. No more wondering what to cook - let Recipe Remix help you make the most of what's in your kitchen!

## Project Name
Recipe Remix

## Brief Description
Recipe Remix is an AI-powered recipe transformation platform that helps users modify and adapt recipes to their dietary preferences and restrictions. The application allows users to input existing recipes and receive AI-generated variations that maintain the essence of the original dish while accommodating different dietary needs, ingredient substitutions, and cooking methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding and implementing AI/LLM integration for recipe transformation
- Developing skills in natural language processing for recipe analysis
- Learning to handle complex data structures for recipe ingredients and instructions
- Gaining experience with modern web development frameworks and tools
- Understanding user experience design for recipe-based applications

## Project Scope
### Included Features
- Recipe input and parsing system
- AI-powered recipe transformation engine
- Dietary preference and restriction management
- Ingredient substitution suggestions
- Recipe variation generation
- User-friendly interface for recipe input and output
- Basic user authentication and recipe saving

### Out of Scope
- Complex meal planning features
- Nutritional analysis
- Social sharing features
- Mobile application
- Advanced user profiles and preferences

## Technologies
- Frontend:
  - React/Next.js for the user interface
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - TypeScript for type safety
- Backend:
  - Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes
  - OpenAI API for recipe transformation
- Database:
